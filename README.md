## üìù **Installation Instructions**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dynamic_Inventory_Tracking_System.git
cd Dynamic_Inventory_Tracking_System
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up the Backend**
- Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```
- **Install Dependencies**: 
```bash
npm install
```
- **Configure MySQL Database**:  
Update the MySQL database configuration in the `config/db.config.js` file:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    HOST: "localhost",
    USER: "root",
    PASSWORD: "password",
    DB: "inventory_db"
};
```
Make sure to replace "localhost", "root", and "password" with your MySQL credentials.

- **Start the Backend Server**:
```bash
npm start
```
The backend will now be running at **http://localhost:3000**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up the Frontend**
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```
- **Install Angular Dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```
- **Set the API Endpoint**:  
In `src/environments/environment.ts`, set the API URL to point to your backend server:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api'
};
```
- **Start the Angular Frontend**:
```bash
ng serve
```
The Angular frontend will now be running at **http://localhost:4200**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Database Setup**

#### Create the Database:
Run the following SQL command in MySQL:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
```

#### Create a MySQL User:
Create a user with necessary privileges to interact with the `inventory_db`:
```sql
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON inventory_db.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
```
Make sure to replace `'user'` and `'password'` with your desired credentials.

---

## üöÄ **Running the Application**

1. **Start the Backend Server** at **http://localhost:3000**.
2. **Start the Frontend Server** at **http://localhost:4200**.
3. Open **http://localhost:4200** in your browser to access the **Dynamic Inventory Tracking System**.

---

## üì° **API Endpoints**

The backend exposes the following **REST API** endpoints for interacting with the inventory system:

- **POST** `/api/products`: Add a new product to the inventory.
    - Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Product Name",
      "category": "Product Category",
      "quantity": 100,
      "price": 20.50
    }
    ```

- **GET** `/api/products`: Retrieve a list of all products in the inventory.

- **GET** `/api/products/:id`: Get the details of a specific product by its ID.

- **PUT** `/api/products/:id`: Update product details (name, category, quantity, price) for a given product ID.
    - Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Updated Product Name",
      "category": "Updated Category",
      "quantity": 120,
      "price": 22.00
    }
    ```

- **DELETE** `/api/products/:id`: Delete a product from the inventory by its ID.

---

## üîê **User Authentication**

The system supports secure user authentication using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).

To authenticate, send a **POST** request to `/api/auth/login` with your **username** and **password**:
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
On successful login, the server will return a **JWT token**, which should be included in the **Authorization header** for subsequent API requests.

---

## üèÅ **Challenges**
### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges Faced**:
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that data is consistently updated across the frontend, backend, and database, especially with multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.
- **Scalability**: As the product catalog grows, managing large datasets can lead to performance issues. Optimizing queries and improving backend processing is crucial.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure and reliable user authentication with JWT tokens requires attention to session management and token expiration.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and input validation are essential for system stability and to prevent crashes or data corruption.

---

## üöÄ **Future Enhancements**
- **üîÑ Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Implement real-time stock updates using WebSockets to instantly reflect changes in inventory.
- **üìà Data Analytics**: Provide insightful analytics on inventory trends, product demand, and sales forecasts.
- **üíª Multi-User Support**: Enable multiple roles with different access levels (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
- **üì¶ Integration with Other Systems**: Integrate with external supply chain and ERP systems for a seamless workflow.

---

## üèÖ **Conclusion**

The **Dynamic Inventory Tracking System** offers an intuitive, web-based solution to manage inventory efficiently. By leveraging **Angular** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **MySQL** for data storage, the system is built for scalability and real-time performance. The integration of secure **JWT authentication** ensures safe and controlled access for users.
