## 📝 **Installation Instructions**

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dynamic_Inventory_Tracking_System.git
cd Dynamic_Inventory_Tracking_System

2️⃣ Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure MySQL Database:
Update the MySQL database configuration in the config/db.config.js file:
javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
    HOST: "localhost",
    USER: "root",
    PASSWORD: "password",
    DB: "inventory_db"
};
Make sure to replace "localhost", "root", and "password" with your MySQL credentials.

Start the Backend Server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

3️⃣ Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install Angular Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set the API Endpoint:
In src/environments/environment.ts, set the API URL to point to your backend server:
typescript
Copy code
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api'
};
Start the Angular Frontend:
bash
Copy code
ng serve
The Angular frontend will now be running at http://localhost:4200.

4️⃣ Database Setup
Create the Database:
Run the following SQL command in MySQL:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
Create a MySQL User:
Create a user with necessary privileges to interact with the inventory_db:

sql
Copy code
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON inventory_db.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
Make sure to replace 'user' and 'password' with your desired credentials.

🚀 Running the Application
Start the Backend Server at http://localhost:3000.
Start the Frontend Server at http://localhost:4200.
Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser to access the Dynamic Inventory Tracking System.
📡 API Endpoints
The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints for interacting with the inventory system:

POST /api/products: Add a new product to the inventory.

Request body:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "category": "Product Category",
  "quantity": 100,
  "price": 20.50
}
GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of all products in the inventory.

GET /api/products/:id: Get the details of a specific product by its ID.

PUT /api/products/:id: Update product details (name, category, quantity, price) for a given product ID.

Request body:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Updated Product Name",
  "category": "Updated Category",
  "quantity": 120,
  "price": 22.00
}
DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product from the inventory by its ID.

🔐 User Authentication
The system supports secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

To authenticate, send a POST request to /api/auth/login with your username and password:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123"
}
On successful login, the server will return a JWT token, which should be included in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests.

🏁 Challenges
⚠️ Challenges Faced:
Data Consistency: Ensuring that data is consistently updated across the frontend, backend, and database, especially with multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.
Scalability: As the product catalog grows, managing large datasets can lead to performance issues. Optimizing queries and improving backend processing is crucial.
User Authentication: Implementing secure and reliable user authentication with JWT tokens requires attention to session management and token expiration.
Error Handling: Proper error handling and input validation are essential for system stability and to prevent crashes or data corruption.
🚀 Future Enhancements
🔄 Real-Time Inventory Tracking: Implement real-time stock updates using WebSockets to instantly reflect changes in inventory.
📈 Data Analytics: Provide insightful analytics on inventory trends, product demand, and sales forecasts.
💻 Multi-User Support: Enable multiple roles with different access levels (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
📦 Integration with Other Systems: Integrate with external supply chain and ERP systems for a seamless workflow.
🏅 Conclusion
The Dynamic Inventory Tracking System offers an intuitive, web-based solution to manage inventory efficiently. By leveraging Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MySQL for data storage, the system is built for scalability and real-time performance. The integration of secure JWT authentication ensures safe and controlled access for users.
